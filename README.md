# Clustering discretization methods for generation of material performance databases  in machine learning and design optimization

Repo for Li, Kafka, Gao et al 2019 "Clustering discretization methods for generation of material performance databases  in machine learning and design optimization". If you use our software/code, please cite us!



# Usage overview

The code used for sections 3 and 4 of the paper is provided. The software for SCA/VCA/FCA used in section 2 has *not* been made avaliable. 

*** This package requires the "Deep Learning" MATLAB toolbox ***

This package contains the code used in the sections of the paper as follows:
- /FFNN. Contains the code used to produce the results shown in Section 3.4 - "Feed forward neural networks with SCA database"
- /CNN. Contains the code used to produce the results shown in Section 3.6 - "Convolutional neural networks with SCA database"
- /TOPOPT. Contains code used for topology optimization in Section 4

To reproduce the results from each of these sections, one can simply download the repo and follow the associated read_me file. You ought to get results similar, though perhaps not exactly the same, as those shown in the manuscript.

Data generated with SCA for training the neural networks is provided as a demonstration. These databases, as well as the trained neural net used for topology optimization, are collected in /Databases for convience. These are identical to the databases within the various sub-folders.

To test out different loading cases for the CNN and FFNN code has been provided to generate a random load history to simulate. This is avaliable by commenting and uncommenting specific lines.

# Notes

Some of the topology optimization code is based on: http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s001580050176, as noted in the manuscript. The full citation is: Sigmund, O. (2001).
